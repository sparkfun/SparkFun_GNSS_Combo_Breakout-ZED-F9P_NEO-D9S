At a minimum, you will need to attach an external antenna to the SparkFun GNSS Combo Breakout ZED-F9P NEO-D9S, supply 3.3V power, and connect to one of the board's peripherals.

### Attaching an External Antenna

Plug in one of our patch antennas with SMA connector to the GPS board. Secure the connection using the hex nut until it is finger-tight.
